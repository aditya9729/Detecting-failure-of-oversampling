# Detecting-failure-of-oversampling

Imbalanced datasets are a really tough to deal with. Data Scientists use various techniques like undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE and modified SMOTE. 

This dataset has combined data from demographics, climate and pollution data till the year 2010. The goal was to predict tuberculosis in certain affected parts of India previously affected. A team of students worked on this data and oversampled the dataset using SMOTE. The problem - Oversampling the dataset led to a training accuracy of 100% and the students didn't understand where they were going wrong. I have used methods like cross validation, geospatial analysis to showcase overplotting in the data.
